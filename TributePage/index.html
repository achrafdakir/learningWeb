            <h3 class="headline">Here's a timeline of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London, England.</li>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - Begins studying at King's College, Cambridge, where he excels in mathematics.</li>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> - Publishes his seminal paper "On Computable Numbers," introducing the concept of a Turing machine, a foundation for modern computing.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Earns his PhD from Princeton University, studying under Alonzo Church.</li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> - Joins the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park at the onset of World War II.</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong> - Develops the Bombe machine, instrumental in decrypting German Enigma messages.</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Receives the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his war contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>1948</strong> - Joins the University of Manchester, working on the Manchester Mark I and exploring artificial intelligence concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - Publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," introducing the Turing Test for machine intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - Convicted under outdated British laws for his homosexuality and undergoes chemical castration.</li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - Tragically dies at the age of 41 from cyanide poisoning, ruled a suicide.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Receives an official apology from British Prime Minister Gordon Brown for the treatment he suffered.</li>
